# BI Analyst Interview Prep

This project organizes educational material for BI Analyst interview preparation. It mirrors the major topics from `interview_preparation.txt` and prepares the content for future publication on GitHub Pages.

## Structure
- `Role_Overview/` – foundational context about the BI Analyst role
- `Core_Technical_Skills/` – one folder per technical skill area
- `Best_Practices_and_Methodologies/` – process and collaboration topics
- `shared/` – templates and cross-cutting assets
- `content_reviews/` – reviewer notes and quality feedback
- `prompts/` – reusable prompt templates and run logs
- `docs/` – finalized markdown, ready for GitHub Pages

## Next Steps
1. Flesh out prompt templates in `prompts/`.
2. Generate initial drafts for each subject in the corresponding folders.
3. Capture review feedback in `content_reviews/` and iterate.
4. Once stable, copy polished content into `docs/` and add navigation for GitHub Pages.
