# Shared Templates & Assets

This directory stores reusable artifacts referenced across training modules:
- Sample datasets for labs (CSV/JSON/Parquet extracts)
- Wireframes and storyboard images
- Backlog and requirements templates
- Monitoring dashboards or cost analysis spreadsheets

Organize subfolders by module name when needed. Keep binaries small and document larger assets with links.
